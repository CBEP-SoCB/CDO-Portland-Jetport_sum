# Read Data
The frost-free period needs to be derived directly from the daily temperature data.  Note that temperature in the source data is in tenths of a degree C.
```{r}
sibfldnm <- 'Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- paste(parent,sibfldnm, sep = '/')
fn <- 'longdailydata.csv'

longdailydata <- read_csv(paste(sibling,fn, sep = '/')) %>%
  select(-station) %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('TMAX', 'TMIN')) %>%
  mutate(doy =  as.numeric(format(date, format='%j'))) %>%
  mutate(month = as.numeric(format(date, format='%m'))) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, format='%Y'))) %>%
  mutate(cyear = year-1980)
```

# Find First and Last Frost Dates
The following strategy was suggested by a Stack Overflow answer here:  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41328946/find-last-values-by-condition

In brief, we filter a dataframe down to data that meets our criteria -- here, days with temperatures below freezing -- and then group_by() to isolate data from each year, and finally slice() to pick the first or last item in the list.  Be aware that this strategy depends on the data being in chronological order.
```{r}
cutoffinF <- 32
cutoffinC <- (cutoffinF - 32) * 5/9

firstfrosts <- longdailydata %>%
  spread(key = datatype, value = value) %>%
  filter(year>1940) %>%                 # 1940 is an incomplete year in the daily data
  mutate(TMIN = TMIN/10) %>%            # raw data is in tenths of degree C
  filter(TMIN<= cutoffinC) %>%          # Only days below freezing
  filter(month>=7) %>%                  # only the last half of the year
  group_by(year) %>%
  slice(1)  %>%                         # Choose the first record
  select(date, year, doy)

lastfrosts <- longdailydata %>%
  spread(key = datatype, value = value) %>%
  filter(year>1940) %>%                 # 1940 is an incomplete year in the daily data
  mutate(TMIN = TMIN/10) %>%            # raw data is in tenths of degree C
  filter(TMIN<= cutoffinC) %>%          # Only days below freezing
  filter(month<7) %>%                   # only the first half of the year
  group_by(year) %>%
  slice(n())  %>%                       # Choose the last record
  select(date, year, doy)

frosts <- inner_join(firstfrosts,lastfrosts, by = "year", suffix = c('.first', '.last')) %>%
  mutate(frostfree = doy.first - doy.last - 1) # calculate frost-free period

rm(firstfrosts,lastfrosts)
```

# Statistical Analysis
## Frost Free Period
We start with a Gaussian model.
```{r}
ffdays.lm <- lm(frostfree~ year, data = frosts)
summary(ffdays.lm)
```
So, on average, the number of frost free days over the last 80 years has 
declined by about half a day a year, or about 39 days overall.
```{r}
 round(coef(ffdays.lm)[2]*80,2)
```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ffdays.lm)
par(oldpar)
```
Theoretically, we are dealing with count data, so perhaps something other than a
Gaussian model (Binomial, Poisson GLM?)  would perform better, but we don't see
any strong deviations (here) from normality. That's not unreasonable since the
binomial distribution for high counts converges on a normal distribution.

## Date of First Frosts
```{r}
firstfrosts.lm <- lm(doy.first ~ year, data = frosts)
summary(firstfrosts.lm)
```
Slightly more than half of the trend in length of growing season is due to later 
first frosts, about 23 days.
```{r}
 round(coef(firstfrosts.lm )[2]*80,2)
```
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(firstfrosts.lm)
par(oldpar)
```

## Date of Last Spring Frost
```{r}
lastfrosts.lm <- lm(doy.last ~ year, data = frosts)
summary(lastfrosts.lm)
```

So last frosts have moved just over two weeks earlier over eighty years:
```{r}
round(coef(lastfrosts.lm)[2]*80,2)
```

# Robust alternatives to Gaussian Models
The corresponding Thiel-Sen estimators are similar.  Here we use the 'mblm'
or "Median Based Linear Models" functions from the mblm package.  This fits a
Theil-Sen estimator, which is a more robust version of fitting a linear trend.
I also run a Kendal's Tau test, which is (roughly) a test that checks if the
Theil-Sen estimator is statistically significant.
```{r}
ffdays.ts <- mblm(frostfree~ year, dataframe = frosts)
summary(ffdays.ts)
cor.test(~frostfree+year, data = frosts, method = 'kendall')
```

```{r}
firstfrosts.ts <- mblm(doy.first ~ year, dataframe = frosts)
summary(firstfrosts.ts)
cor.test(~doy.first+year, data = frosts, method = 'kendall')
```

```{r}
lastfrosts.ts <- mblm(doy.last ~ year, dataframe = frosts)
summary(lastfrosts.ts)
cor.test(~doy.last+year, data = frosts, method = 'kendall')
```
