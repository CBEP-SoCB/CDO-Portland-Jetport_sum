# Install Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Read Data
```{r}
sibfldnm <- 'Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- paste(parent,sibfldnm, sep = '/')
fn <- 'longannualdata.csv'

longannualdata <- read_csv(paste(sibling,fn, sep = '/')) %>%
  select(-station) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, format='%Y'))) %>%
  mutate(cyear = year-1980)
```

Making sense of that data requires looking at the metadata, but here's a list of 
the datatypes included.

```{r}
levels(factor(longannualdata$datatype))
```
And their frequencies.  Most data records are available for all years, a 
handful that are mostly wind related, are only available more recently.
```{r}
longannualdata %>%
  group_by(datatype) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```

# Annual Minimum, Maximum and Average Temperature
Codes for Key Temperature records in the downloaded annual data are:
*  TAVG  -- Annual Average Temperature (unweighted; effectively average of 
   monthly averages, of daily maxes and mins.  Note that this means this is not 
   independent of the other two metrics.)
*  EMXT  -- Extreme Maximum Annual Temperature
*  EMNT  -- Extreme Minimum Temperature

Note that in 2015 State of the Bay, we calculated our own annual means, mins and 
maxes from the daily records.

## Initial Plot
```{r}
tdata <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('TAVG', 'EMXT', 'EMNT')) %>%
  mutate(value = value*(9/5)+32)

plt <- ggplot(tdata, aes(year, value, color=datatype)) + geom_line(size=1) +
  xlab('Year') +
  theme_cbep() +
  ylab (expression('Temperature ('*~degree*F*')')) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors2(), name = '', 
                     labels = c('Minimum', 'Maximum', 'Mean'))
plt
```

## Linear Trends
```{r}
tdataF <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('TAVG', 'EMXT', 'EMNT')) %>%
  mutate(value = value*(9/5)+32) %>%
  spread(key = datatype, value = value)
mean.lm <- lm(TAVG~ cyear, data = tdataF)
min.lm <- lm(EMNT~ cyear, data = tdataF)
max.lm <- lm(EMXT~ cyear, data = tdataF)
```

### Trend in "mean" Temperature
Remember the mean temperature is based on means of maximums and minimums, in part.
```{r}
summary(mean.lm)
```
So, mean annual temperature has increased about 0.037 degrees F per year, or
about one degree C every twenty seven years. (Note that this "average" may not
be what we would normally consider an average -- we believe it's the average of
daily averages of maximum and minimum temperatures.)

### Trend in Minimum Temperature
```{r}
summary(min.lm)
```
Minimum temperatures have increased substantially faster, climbing 0.1338 
degrees per year, or climbing about one degree F every seven years.
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(min.lm)
par(oldpar)
```
No terrible violations of assumptions there.

### Trend in Maximum Temperature
```{r}
summary(max.lm)
```
Maximum temperatures continue to not show a long term trend.

#  Precipitation Totals
13.PRCP:  Total Monthly (Annual) precipitation. Precipitation totals are based 
on daily or multi-day (if daily is missing) precipitation report, in millimeters 
to tenths.

18.SNOW Total Monthly (Annual) Snowfall in millimeters.

```{r}
pdatalong <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('PRCP', 'SNOW')) %>%
  mutate(datatype = factor(datatype)) %>%
  mutate(value = value*0.0394)

pdata <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('PRCP', 'SNOW')) %>%
  mutate(datatype = factor(datatype)) %>%
  mutate(value = value*0.0394) %>%
  spread(key=datatype, value=value)
```

## Linear Models
### Total Annual Snowfal
```{r}
snow.lm <- lm(SNOW~year, data = pdata)
summary(snow.lm)
```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(snow.lm)
par(oldpar)
```

### Total Annual Precipitation
```{r}
precip.lm <- lm(PRCP~year, data = pdata)
summary(precip.lm)
```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(precip.lm)
par(oldpar)
```

So, Precipitation is increasing by about 1 inch every 7 years, or close to a 
10 inch increase in annual average rainfall since 1940.

It's worth also wondering if the variance in rainfall has increased in any
meaningful way, but that appears unlikly eyeballing the  data.  For that we'd
need to look at some definition of drought based on monthly or daily
precipitation totals.
