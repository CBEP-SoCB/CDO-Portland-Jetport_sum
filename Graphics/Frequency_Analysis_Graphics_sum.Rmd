# Temperature Exeedences
## Read Data
The Annual Data Downloaded from NOAA's Climate Data Online includes counts of
the number of days exceeding various temperature thresholds, as follows:

*  DX90: Number of days with maximum temperature >= 32.2°C/90°F.  
*  DX70: Number of days with maximum temperature >= 21.1°C/70°F.  
*  DX32: Number of days with maximum temperature <= 0°C/32°F.  
*  DT32: Number of days with minimum temperature <= 0°C/32°F.  
*  DT00: Number of days with minimum temperature <= -17.8°C/0°F.  

```{r folders}
sibfldnm <- 'Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- paste(parent,sibfldnm, sep = '/')
fn <- 'longannualdata.csv'

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

```{r load_weather_data}
longannualdata <- read_csv(paste(sibling,fn, sep = '/')) %>%
  select(-station) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, format='%Y'))) %>%
  mutate(cyear = year-1980)
```

We focus on days that dropped  below 32, and days  that got as low as 0 degrees
F.  Notice that even though the CDO data was downloaded in metric units, these
cumulative counts are based on English units.
```{r format_cold_data}
textdatalong <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('DT32', 'DT00'))

textdata <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('DT32', 'DT00')) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = datatype, values_from = value)
```

## Poisson Models
Note that while we prefer the quasi-Poisson models for inference, the
predictions of the the Poisson models are identical. They differ only in
dispersion.  For plotting purposes, since we don't show model dispersion on the
plots, the two are functionally identical.
```{r cold_poisson_models}
lt32GLM <- glm(DT32 ~ year, family = poisson, data = textdata)
lt00GLM <- glm(DT00 ~ year, family = poisson, data = textdata)
```

```{r cold_prediction_lines}
lines <- tibble(yr = seq(1940,2020),
                lt32 = exp(coef(lt32GLM)[1] + 
                             coef(lt32GLM)[2]  * 
                             seq(1940,2020) ),
                lt00 = exp(coef(lt00GLM)[1] + 
                             coef(lt00GLM)[2]  *
                             seq(1940,2020) ),
                 ) 
lines_df <- lines %>%
  pivot_longer(lt32:lt00, names_to = 'prediction', values_to = 'value') %>%
  mutate(prediction = factor(prediction, levels = c('lt32','lt00')))
```

## Plotting
### Basic Graphic
This graphic differs from the one in SoCB largely by including a legend.
```{r cold_dots}

plt <- ggplot(textdatalong, aes(x=year))+
  geom_point(aes(y=value), color='grey85', size = 1) +
  
  geom_line(data = lines_df, aes(x=yr, y=value, color = prediction)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[c(4,5)], name = '',
                     labels = c('Below Freezing',
                                'Below Zero')) +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 9) +
  
  theme(legend.position=c(0.80, 0.5)) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab("Number of Cold Days")

plt

ggsave('figures/frequencycolddots.pdf',
       device=cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 4)
```

### Add Annotations
We need predictions to pull out "typical" values from the 1940s 
and the 2010s to annotate the plot.
```{r cold_preds}
sel_preds <- data.frame(year=c(1945, 2015))
lt32pred <- predict(lt32GLM, newdata=sel_preds, type='response')
lt00pred <- predict(lt00GLM, newdata=sel_preds, type='response')
(sel_preds <- tibble(year = sel_preds$year,
                 DT32=lt32pred,
                 DT00 =lt00pred))
```

So, assemble a dataframe containing the annotations.

```{r cold_annot}
labs<-tibble(year=c(1945, 2015, 1945, 2015),
             y = c(45,25,140, 120),
            txt= c(paste('~', round(sel_preds$DT00[sel_preds$year == 1945],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DT00[sel_preds$year == 2015],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DT32[sel_preds$year == 1945],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DT32[sel_preds$year == 2015],0), 'per year')))
             
```

```{r plot_cold_annot}
plt +  geom_text(aes(x=year, y=y, label=txt), data = labs, size = 3)

ggsave('figures/frequencycolddots.pdf',
      device=cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 4)
```

# Precipitation Frequencies
6. DP01: Number of days with >= 0.01 inch/0.254 millimeter in the month (year).
7. DP10: Number of days with >= 0.1 inch/2.54 millimeter in the month (year).
8. DP1X: Number of days with >= 1.0 inch (25.4mm) precipitation in the month (year).
9. DSNW: Number of days with snowfall >= 1 inch (25 mm).
10.DSND: Number of days with snow depth >= 1 inch (25 mm).

We are interested in large rain events, so DP1X from this list. The list 
does not include the number of days with more than two inches of rain,
which is arguably a better metric of intense storms than the one inch rain
threshold.  Since that is not provided by NOAA directly, it needs to be derived 
from the daily data, as we do here.

## Read Data
```{r format_rain_data}
pextdata <- longannualdata %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('DP1X')) %>%
  select(-attributes) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = datatype, values_from = value)
```

```{r calculate_exceeds_two}
# Days with two inches of rain or more
fn <- 'longdailydata.csv'

num2inch <- 
  # Read daily data
  read_csv(paste(sibling,fn, sep = '/')) %>%
  select(-station) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, format='%Y')))  %>%
  select(date,year, datatype, value) %>%
  
  # Filter down to only precipitation data
  filter(datatype=='PRCP') %>%
  rename(PRCP = value) %>%
  filter( ! is.na(PRCP)) %>%
  
  # Convert to inches. Original data in tenths of mm
  mutate(PRCP_IN = PRCP * 0.0393700787 / 10) %>% 
  filter(year > 1940) %>%   # 1940 is an incomplete year in the daily data
  
  # And count the number of high rain events
  filter(PRCP_IN >= 2) %>%  # Only days with two inches of rain or more
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(COUNT = n())    # use all caps because "count" is a builtin function
```

So far, this will be wrong for years that have no large storms, since each Year
with no large storms will be dropped from the data frame.  We want years with 
zero intense storms to be included in the data with a value of zero.  We can fix 
that using a left_join to the one inch rainfall data (which includes all years 
in the instrumented record).
```{r join_rain_data}
pextdata <- left_join(pextdata, num2inch, by='year') %>%
  mutate(COUNT=replace_na(COUNT,0)) %>%
  rename(DP2X = COUNT) %>%
  mutate(cyear = year-1980)

pextdatalong <- pextdata %>%
  pivot_longer(DP1X:DP2X, values_to = 'value', names_to = 'datatype') %>%
  mutate(datatype = factor(datatype, 
                           levels = c('DP1X', 'DP2X')))

rm(num2inch)
```

## Poisson Models
```{r rain_poisson_models}
gt1GLM <- glm(DP1X ~ year, family = poisson, data = pextdata)
gt2GLM <- glm(DP2X ~ year, family = poisson, data = pextdata)
```

```{r rain_prediciton_lines}
lines <- tibble(yr = seq(1940,2020),
                DP1X = exp(coef(gt1GLM)[1] + 
                             coef(gt1GLM)[2]  * 
                             seq(1940,2020) ),
                DP2X = exp(coef(gt2GLM)[1] + 
                             coef(gt2GLM)[2]  *
                             seq(1940,2020) ),
                 )

lines_df <- lines %>%
  pivot_longer(DP1X:DP2X, names_to = 'prediction', values_to = 'value') %>%
  mutate(prediction = factor(prediction, levels = c('DP1X', 'DP2X')))
```

## Plotting
This graphic is similar to the one used in State of Casco Bay except for the 
presence of the legend. 
```{r dots_heavy_rainfall}

plt <- pextdatalong %>%
  filter(datatype %in% c('DP1X', 'DP2X')) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=year)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=value, shape = datatype),color='grey85', size = 1) +
  
  
  geom_line(data = lines_df, aes(x=yr, y=value, color = prediction)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors(), name = '',
                     labels = c('More than One Inch',
                                'More than Two Inches')) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(16, 1), name = '',
                     labels = c('More than One Inch',
                                'More than Two Inches')) +
  
  ylab("Days with Heavy Precipitation") +
  xlab('') +
  
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.85))
plt

ggsave('figures/highrainfalldots.pdf',
      device=cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 4)
```

### Add Annotations
We need to calculate a few summary estimates to include in the graphics.  The
following two blocks of code  gives us a gauge of "typical" conditions for each
decade, based on all the available data, not just the data from that decade.
```{r rain_preds}
sel_preds <- data.frame(year=c(1945, 2015))
gt1pred <- predict(gt1GLM, newdata=sel_preds, type='response')
gt2pred <- predict(gt2GLM, newdata=sel_preds, type='response')
(sel_preds <- tibble(year = sel_preds$year, 
                 DP1X = gt1pred,
                 DP2X = gt2pred))
```

So, days with more than one inch of rain  have gone from about eight a year in
the 1940s to about thirteen a year in the 2010s. Days with two or more inches of 
rain have gone from about one a year to about three a year.

```{r rain_annots}
labs<-tibble(year=c(1945, 2015, 1945,2015),
             y = c(10, 17,-0.5,-0.5),
             txt= c(paste('~', round(sel_preds$DP1X[sel_preds$year == 1945],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DP1X[sel_preds$year == 2015],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DP2X[sel_preds$year == 1945],0), 'per year'),
                    paste('~', round(sel_preds$DP2X[sel_preds$year == 2015],0), 'per year')))

```


```{r plot_rain_annot}
plt +  geom_text(aes(x=year, y=y, label=txt), data = labs, size = 3)

ggsave('figures/highrainfalldots_annotations.pdf',
      device=cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 4)
```
